# Smart Spend U
A student focused budgeting and financial tracking application built in Python for the IS Application Development course.  
Smart Spend U allows users to track income and expenses, organize spending by category, and view summaries that help guide responsible financial decision making throughout the academic year.

## 📌 Project Overview
Smart Spend U is a console based Python application designed for college students who need an easy way to understand where their money is going. Students often struggle with budgeting due to inconsistent income (such as part time jobs or refunds) and unexpected expenses. This tool makes personal finance simple, intuitive, and accessible.

The application stores all transactions in a CSV file so that user data persists across sessions without requiring complex database setup.
